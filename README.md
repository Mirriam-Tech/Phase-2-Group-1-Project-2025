# üé¨ Movie Data Analysis Project - Group 1

##  Overview

This project analyzes historical movie industry data to help guide business decisions for a new movie studio. Using data from multiple sources, we perform exploratory data analysis to answer key business questions about what types of movies succeed at the box office.

## Business Problem

The studio seeks to answer the following core questions:

1Ô∏è‚É£ What genres tend to perform best at the box office?  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Do critic ratings predict box office success?  
3Ô∏è‚É£ How do production budgets correlate with box office revenue?  
4Ô∏è‚É£ Does release timing (season, month) impact revenue?

Our goal is to provide data-driven recommendations on genre focus, budget allocation, and release strategy.

## üìÅ Datasets Used

- **IMDB**: Movie titles, genres, and ratings (SQLite database)
- **Box Office Mojo (BOM)**: Domestic and foreign gross earnings (CSV)
- **The Numbers**: Production budget and worldwide revenue (CSV)
- **Rotten Tomatoes**: Reviews and critic information (TSV)

## üßπ  Data Cleaning & Preparation

- Cleaned currency columns, removed special characters and converted to float to prevent overflow errors.
- Converted dates to pandas datetime format.
- Extracted release year and release month for seasonality analysis.
- Standardized titles using lowercase and stripped whitespace to ensure safe merging.
- Filtered out movies with fewer than 50 votes for rating stability.
- Exploded genre fields to analyze individual genres.

## üí° Key Findings

- **Top Genres**: Adventure, Animation, Fantasy, and Sci-Fi dominate box office revenue globally.
- **Ratings**: Weak correlation to revenue; high ratings do not guarantee high revenue.
- **Budgets**: Strong positive correlation between production budget and revenue.
- **Release Timing**: Summer and holiday releases (May - July, November - December) outperform others.

---

## ‚úÖ Business Recommendations

- Prioritize production in Adventure, Animation, Fantasy, and Sci-Fi.
- Plan release schedules around seasonal high-performing months.
- Use critic ratings as supplemental but not predictive indicators.
- Manage budgets carefully; large budgets bring higher revenue but higher financial risk.
